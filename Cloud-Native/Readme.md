# Cloud Native

## Introduction to Cloud Native

Cloud native is an approach to building and running applications that exploit the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. Cloud native development focuses on how to optimally utilize cloud services and infrastructure to develop applications that are resilient, manageable, and observable.

Key characteristics of cloud native applications include:

- **[Microservices Architecture](1-Microservices/Readme.md)**: Building applications as a collection of small, loosely coupled services.
- **Containerization**: Packaging applications and their dependencies into containers.
- **Dynamic Orchestration**: Managing and scheduling containers using orchestrators like Kubernetes.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating the process of deploying applications.
- **DevOps Culture**: Promoting a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams.

## Core Cloud Native Tools

### 1. **Kubernetes**

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. It provides container-centric infrastructure, allowing applications to be rapidly deployed and easily managed.

- **Website**: [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io)
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated rollouts and rollbacks
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Service discovery and load balancing
  - Storage orchestration
  - Secret and configuration management

### 2. [**Docker**](Docker/Readme.md)

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments.

- **Website**: [docker.com](https://www.docker.com)
- **Key Features**:
  - Lightweight and portable containers
  - Version control for container images
  - Integrated developer tools
  - Wide adoption and community support

### 3. **Prometheus**

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is widely used for monitoring cloud native applications.

- **Website**: [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io)
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-dimensional data model
  - Powerful query language (PromQL)
  - Efficient time series database
  - Alerting based on PromQL

### 4. **Istio**

Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a way to control how microservices share data with one another. It provides tools for traffic management, security, and observability.

- **Website**: [istio.io](https://istio.io)
- **Key Features**:
  - Traffic routing and load balancing
  - Secure service-to-service communication
  - Policy enforcement
  - Telemetry collection

### 5. **Helm**

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, enabling users to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

- **Website**: [helm.sh](https://helm.sh)
- **Key Features**:
  - Simplified application deployment
  - Versioned, shareable packages
  - Easy application updates and rollbacks
  - Template-based configuration

## Large Scale Cloud Native Usage

### **Scalability**

Cloud native applications are designed to scale horizontally, adding more instances of services to handle increased load. Tools like Kubernetes manage scaling and ensure high availability by distributing workloads efficiently.

### **Resilience**

By leveraging microservices and containerization, cloud native applications can isolate failures to individual services, preventing system-wide outages. Orchestration tools automate recovery processes, ensuring minimal downtime.

### **Observability**

Tools like Prometheus and Istio provide deep insights into application performance and health. Monitoring, logging, and tracing are integral to maintaining and improving the reliability of large-scale systems.

### **Automation**

CI/CD pipelines automate the deployment process, ensuring that applications are consistently delivered and updated. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions integrate with Kubernetes to streamline deployments.

### **Security**

Cloud native applications employ robust security practices, such as zero-trust networking and automated vulnerability scanning. Istio provides secure service-to-service communication and policy enforcement to protect sensitive data.

## Conclusion

Adopting a cloud native approach empowers organizations to build scalable, resilient, and manageable applications. By utilizing core tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, Istio, and Helm, and by embracing practices like CI/CD and DevOps, businesses can effectively leverage cloud infrastructure to deliver high-quality software at scale.
