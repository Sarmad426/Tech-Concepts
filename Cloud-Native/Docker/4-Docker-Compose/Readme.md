# Docker Compose Documentation

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Introduction

Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container applications. By using a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can define services, networks, and volumes needed for your application in a simple and straightforward way.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine: Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Install Docker Compose

Docker Compose is included in Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS. For Linux, you can install it separately:

```sh
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep -Po '\"tag_name\": \"v\K[^\"]*')" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

To verify the installation, run:

```sh
docker-compose --version
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Define Your Application Environment

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the services.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: postgres:alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: exampledb
      POSTGRES_USER: exampleuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: examplepass
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

Run the following command in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

This command starts and runs your entire application.

### Step 3: Stop Your Application

To stop the application, run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

## Compose File Structure

A typical `docker-compose.yml` file is structured as follows:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  service_name:
    image: image_name
    build: ./dir
    ports:
      - "host_port:container_port"
    environment:
      - ENV_VAR=value
    volumes:
      - host_path:container_path
    networks:
      - network_name
networks:
  network_name:
    driver: bridge
volumes:
  volume_name:
```

### Key Components

- **version**: The version of the Compose file format.
- **services**: The list of services (containers) to run.
- **networks**: Custom networks to which services can connect.
- **volumes**: Persistent storage volumes for services.

## Basic Commands

- `docker-compose up`: Start and run the application.
- `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`.
- `docker-compose build`: Build or rebuild services.
- `docker-compose pull`: Pull service images.
- `docker-compose logs`: View output from containers.
- `docker-compose ps`: List containers.
- `docker-compose exec`: Execute a command in a running container.

## Advanced Usage

### Using Dockerfile

You can specify a `Dockerfile` to build your own image:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

### Multiple Environments

To handle multiple environments, you can create multiple Compose files and override values:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

### Scaling Services

You can scale services to multiple instances:

```sh
docker-compose up --scale web=3
```

### Networking

Define custom networks for service communication:

```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
services:
  web:
    networks:
      - frontend
  api:
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
  db:
    networks:
      - backend
```

## Best Practices

- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Keep your `docker-compose.yml` file as simple as possible.
- Use named volumes for persistent data.
- Leverage Docker Compose for local development and testing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure host ports specified in `docker-compose.yml` are not already in use.
- **Environment Variable Conflicts**: Check for environment variable conflicts and ensure they are set correctly.

### Debugging Tips

- Use `docker-compose logs` to check container logs.
- Use `docker-compose ps` to ensure all services are running.
- Use `docker-compose exec` to get a shell into running containers for inspection.
