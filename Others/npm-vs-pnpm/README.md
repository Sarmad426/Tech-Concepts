# Difference between npm and pnpm

npm and pnpm are both package managers for JavaScript. However, there are some key differences between the two:

1. **Installation**: npm is the default package manager that comes with Node.js installation. On the other hand, pnpm needs to be installed separately.

2. **Disk Space**: npm installs packages in a project's `node_modules` directory, which can take up a significant amount of disk space, especially when multiple projects have the same dependencies. pnpm, on the other hand, uses a shared store for packages, resulting in significant disk space savings.

3. **Speed**: pnpm is generally faster than npm when it comes to installing and updating packages. This is because pnpm uses hard links and symlinks to reuse packages across projects, reducing the need for duplicate downloads.

4. **Concurrency**: pnpm allows for concurrent installations, which means it can install multiple packages simultaneously. npm, on the other hand, installs packages one by one, which can be slower in comparison.

5. **Compatibility**: npm is widely used and has a large ecosystem of packages. It is compatible with most projects and has good support for different package versions. pnpm, although compatible with most projects, may encounter some compatibility issues with certain packages that rely on specific npm features.

Overall, the choice between npm and pnpm depends on your specific needs and preferences. If disk space and installation speed are important to you, pnpm might be a good choice. However, if compatibility and a large package ecosystem are your priorities, npm is a reliable option.
