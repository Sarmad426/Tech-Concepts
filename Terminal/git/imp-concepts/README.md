# Git

Git is an open-source **Version Control System** (VCS) that maps the changes in your project. It also contains the history, allowing you to jump back to specific changes. The project is called a Git **Repository**.

[Install Git](https://git-scm.com)

## Github

GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts a copy of the repository online. The hosted repository on GitHub or any platform is called a **Remote Repository**.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to performing various Git operations, including creating branches, changing branch names, switching branches, merging branches, and deleting branches. Additionally, I'll provide some best practices for effective team collaboration using Git. This guide will use Markdown syntax with code blocks for easy copying and pasting.

### Git Branching and Collaboration Guide

#### **1. Creating and Switching Branches**

To create and switch to a new branch in Git:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout existing-branch-name
```

#### **2. Changing Branch Names**

To change the name of a branch:

```bash
# Rename the current branch
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

#### **3. Merging Branches**

To merge changes from one branch into another:

```bash
# Switch to the target branch
git checkout target-branch-name

# Merge changes from the source branch
git merge source-branch-name
```

#### **4. Deleting Branches**

To delete a branch (Note: Ensure you are not on the branch you intend to delete):

```bash
# Delete a local branch
git branch -d branch-to-delete

# Force delete a branch (use with caution)
git branch -D branch-to-delete
```

#### **5. Team Collaboration Best Practices**

Here are some best practices for effective team collaboration using Git:

- **Use Descriptive Branch Names:** Choose clear and meaningful branch names that describe the purpose of the branch.
- **Frequent Commits:** Make small, logical commits and commit often to keep the history clean and easy to understand.
- **Pull Before Push:** Always pull the latest changes from the remote repository before pushing your own changes to avoid conflicts.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** When working with a shared remote repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab), create PRs for code review and discussion before merging into the main branch.
- **Code Reviews:** Actively participate in code reviews to maintain code quality and ensure team members are on the same page.
- **Branch Protection:** Protect important branches (e.g., `main` or `master`) to prevent accidental force pushes and ensure only approved changes are merged.
- **Merge Conflicts:** Resolve merge conflicts promptly and communicate with your team to prevent code conflicts from escalating.
- **Commit Messages:** Use informative commit messages with a concise summary in the first line and more detailed descriptions if necessary.
- **Branch Cleanup:** Delete feature branches once they are no longer needed to keep the repository clean.
- **Use Git Hooks:** Implement pre-commit and pre-push hooks to automate code linting, testing, and formatting.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation to help team members understand the project's structure and processes.

Remember to adapt these practices to your team's specific needs and workflow.

Now you have a comprehensive guide to Git branching, collaboration, and best practices. Feel free to copy and paste this Markdown guide into your documentation.

## To check the commit that is not yet pushed to origin

To check the commit that is not yet pushed to the remote repository, you can use the following git command:

```git
git log origin/main..HEAD
```

### Fixing Unrelated Histories in Git

In Git, you might encounter an "unrelated histories" error when trying to merge or pull changes from a remote repository into your local repository. This error occurs when Git detects that the histories of the two repositories have diverged significantly and do not share a common ancestor commit. To resolve this issue, you can follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Confirm Unrelated Histories

Before proceeding, make sure that the "unrelated histories" error has indeed occurred. You will usually see this error message when trying to pull or merge changes from the remote repository:

```shell
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```

If you see this error, it means that Git is warning you that the two repositories have unrelated commit histories.

### Step 2: Decide on the Correct Approach

Before attempting to fix unrelated histories, consider whether it's appropriate for your project. If the repositories indeed have unrelated histories due to different codebases, it may be best to keep them separate or discuss with your team on the best approach.

If merging unrelated histories is the right solution for your project, proceed with the following steps.

### Step 3: Pull with `--allow-unrelated-histories`

To merge unrelated histories, you can use the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag when pulling from the remote repository. Here's how to do it:

```shell
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

- `origin` is the name of your remote repository.
- `main` is the branch you want to pull from. Make sure to adjust these names as needed.

This command tells Git to merge the histories of your local and remote repositories, even if they are unrelated.

### Step 4: Resolve Conflicts

After running the pull command, Git will attempt to merge the unrelated histories. If there are conflicts between the files or changes in the repositories, you will need to resolve them manually.

Git will mark the conflicting sections in your files, and you'll need to edit them to keep the changes you want. After resolving conflicts, make sure to add and commit the changes:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Merge unrelated histories"
```

### Step 5: Push to Remote Repository

Once you've successfully resolved the conflicts and committed the changes, you can push the merged repository to the remote:

```shell
git push origin main
```

This will update the remote repository with the merged commit history.

### Step 6: Communication

It's crucial to communicate with your team or collaborators when merging unrelated histories. Inform them about the changes and the fact that unrelated histories were merged, as this may impact their work or their understanding of the project's history.

## Fixing Unrelated History

Fixing unrelated histories in Git is a useful technique when you need to merge two repositories with different commit histories. However, it should be used with caution, as merging unrelated histories can lead to complications and potential conflicts. Ensure that you understand the implications and communicate with your team before proceeding.

### Log Commits on one-line in terminal

```git
git log --pretty=oneline
```

### Count the Number of Commits Locally

To check the number of commits in a Git repository locally using a terminal, you can use the git rev-list command with the --count option. Here's how you can do it:

```git
git rev-list --count HEAD
```

This command will count the number of commits reachable from the current branch's HEAD.

### Update Git to the Latest Version using Command Line (For Windows)

Check the version first.

```git
git version
```

Now update it to the latest stable version using the terminal.

```git
git update-git-for-windows
```

### Update the remote origin of a repository

```git
git remote set-url origin new-repo
```
