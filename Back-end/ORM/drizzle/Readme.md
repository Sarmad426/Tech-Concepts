# Drizzle ORM

Drizzle ORM is a headless TypeScript ORM with a head. üê≤

It looks and feels simple, performs on day 1000 of your project, lets you do things your way, and is there when you need it.

It‚Äôs the only ORM with both **relational** and **SQL-like** query APIs, providing you the best of both worlds when it comes to accessing your relational data. Drizzle is lightweight, performant, type safe, non-lactose, gluten-free, sober, flexible and serverless-ready by design. Drizzle is not just a library, it‚Äôs an experience. ü§©
