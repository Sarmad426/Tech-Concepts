# SQL (MYSQL)

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. It is a powerful relational database query language. It is not a Case Sensitive Language. In Relational database data is stored in the form of tables, where each row is called a **record** and a column is called a **Field**.

**This documentation is specific for MYSQL.**

## Create a Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE "customers" (
"id" INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
"name" TEXT NOT NULL,
"points" INTEGER NOT NULL,
"birth_date" TEXT NOT NULL,
"state" TEXT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY("id")
);
```

## Insert Data into the Table

```sql
INSERT INTO customers
(name,points,birth_date,state)
VALUES
("Zulqarnain",870,'1999-09-13','FSD'),
("Abbas",790,'1994-06-18','LHR'),
("Nawaz",840,'1998-02-27','ISL'),
("Riaz",1180,'1990-10-12','KAR'),
("Babar",1480,'1993-08-14','MUL');
```

- id is not added because it is by default a unique constraint so it will be taken care by the database server itself.

## Retrieve data from database

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
```

## Comments in SQL

>
> We use the double hyphen (--) to create a single line comment in sql.

```sql
-- This is a comment is SQL.

```

## Retrieve Data from Database Conditionally

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id > 12;
```

## Retrieve Data as Columns From Database

```sql
SELECT id, name, points FROM customers;
```

## Updating the data

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET state = 'HYD'
WHERE id=1;


UPDATE customers
SET state = 'KAR'
WHERE id=2;

UPDATE customers
SET state = 'PES'
WHERE id=3;

```

## Deleting data

```sql
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id = 4;

```

## Expressions upon column values

```sql
SELECT points, points + 30 FROM customers WHERE points <500;
```

## Expression as a Column Name (AS alias)

```sql
SELECT points, points + 30 AS "30 points Bonus" FROM customers WHERE points < 500;
```

## OPERATORS

- ! Not operator
- != Not Equal Operator
- <> Not Equal Operator

## Operators Expression

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points <> 500;
-- In this Case we are extracting values upon which
-- price is not equal to 500.
```

## Unique Data (DISTINCT alias)

- DISTINCT alias is used to filter unique results from the database.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT state FROM customers
```

> In this case we will get the unique state. No Duplication in the results.

## AND, OR , NOT operator

- We combine multiple conditions using these Operators.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points > 500 AND birth_date < '2000-01-01' ;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points > 500 OR
birth_date < '2000-01-01' ;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE NOT points > 500 AND  birth_date < '2000-01-01' ;
```

## BETWEEN Operator

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points
BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;
```

> The BETWEEN Operator ranges the values. In this case it is filtering values that are in between 500 and 1000.This Expression is exactly equivalent to this Complex Expression.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points >=500 AND points<=1000;
```

## IN Operator

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state IN ('KAR','LHR');
```

- This will list the results in which state is equal to
  KAR or LHR. This Expression is exactly equal to this one.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE
state = 'KAR' OR state = 'LHR';
```

## Like Operator

Like operator is used for searching string patterns.

>Get customers whose name starts with b. (Capital or Small)

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE name LIKE 'b%';
```

> Get customers whose name ends with b.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE name LIKE '%b';
```

> Search a name that has bas anywhere in the name.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE name LIKE '%bas%';
```

## REGEXP Operator (Regular Expression)

> Search a name that has bas anywhere in the name.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE name REGEXP 'bas';
```

> Search those whose name starts with zul.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE name REGEXP '^zul';
```

> Search those whose name ends with zul.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE name REGEXP 'zul$';
```

> Search customers whose name either contain mark or simon.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE name REGEXP 'mark|simon' 
```

> Now form mark, simon and rose

``` SQL
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE name REGEXP 'mark|simon|rose' 
```

## IS NULL Operator

```SQL
SELECT * FROM 
customers WHERE state IS NULL; 
```

This will output the values where state is null. Null means the absence of a value.

- We can also use the `NOT` operator to negate this condition.
  
```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE state IS NOT NULL;
```

This will result the customers where state is not null.

## ORDER BY Operator

This operator is used to sort data in the output results. By default data is sorted by the id because id is the primary key.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers 
ORDER BY name
```

This will give data sorted by the name.

## DESC Operator (Descending)

Let's sort data in descending order.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers 
ORDER BY name DESC
```
